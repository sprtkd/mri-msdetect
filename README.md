# mri-msdetect
Research Project on MS Detection in Brain MRI Scans using 3D Convolutional Autoencoder

This project was done as a B.Tech Final Project under Prof. Arindam Biswas, IT Dept, IIEST, Shibpur

# Contributers:
* Suprotik Dey
* Mimat Khalil Kasu

# Requirements:
* This project is based on 3D autoencoder architecture, thus it needs serious hardware acceleration.
* This project was run on Google Colab, leveraging its GPU acceleration
* Requirements present in requirements.txt
